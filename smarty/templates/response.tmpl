        Greetings,

        <br/><br/>

        No viruses were detected in your files.  However, please be advised that although none were
        not detected, the file is not necessarily virus free.  Please take a moment to verify that:

        <ol>
            <li>The email address of the attachment sender is a known and trusted contact.</li>
            <li>The attachment filename's and extentions pertain to files you were expecting to receive.</li>
            <li>The file sizes of the attachments reasonably match what you were expecting.</li>
        </ol>

        <br/><br/>

        If you have any questions or further concerns please contact 
        the IT Help Desk at your earliest convenience.
